A comprehensive, living document on state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithms, implementations, and phase transitions.

---

This resource maps advanced matrix decomposition techniques that impose structural constraints (sparsity, low-rank, non-negativity) on unknown factors, with emphasis on methods exhibiting **phase transitions** - sharp boundaries where algorithms transition from failure to success. The first instance of this resource was started on [August 2011 on Nuit Blanche](https://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2011/08/current-jungle-in-matrix-factorization.html).

### Topics Covered

- **Robust PCA & Stable PCA** - Separating low-rank from sparse components
- **Matrix Completion** - Netflix problem and nuclear norm minimization
- **Dictionary Learning** - Sparse coding and learned representations
- **Sparse PCA** - Sparse principal components
- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** - Parts-based representations
- **Archetypal Analysis** - Convex hull representations
- **Binary Matrix Factorization** - Discrete factor matrices
- **MMV & Compressive Sensing** - Multiple measurement vectors
- **Tensor Decompositions** - Higher-order factorizations
- **Neural Methods** - LoRA, autoencoders, implicit regularization
- **Graph Matching** - Correspondence problems

### Contributing

Know of a decomposition or factorization technique that's missing? [Open an issue](https://github.com/IgorCarron/welcome-to-the-matrix-factorization-jungle/issues/new/choose) with the paper reference, a brief description, and ideally a link to code/repo if available would be outstanding. If you have identified a phase transition, please mention the article and the figure in which it is viewable.
