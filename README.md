## [View the Live Page](https://igorcarron.github.io/welcome-to-the-matrix-factorization-jungle/)

A comprehensive, living document on state-of-the-art matrix factorization algorithms, implementations, and phase transitions.

---

This resource maps advanced matrix decomposition techniques that impose structural constraints (sparsity, low-rank, non-negativity) on unknown factors, with emphasis on methods exhibiting **phase transitions** - sharp boundaries where algorithms transition from failure to success.

### Topics Covered

- **Matrix Completion** - Netflix problem and nuclear norm minimization
- **Dictionary Learning** - Sparse coding and learned representations
- **Sparse PCA** - Sparse principal components
- **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** - Parts-based representations
- **Archetypal Analysis** - Convex hull representations
- **Binary Matrix Factorization** - Discrete factor matrices
- **MMV & Compressive Sensing** - Multiple measurement vectors
- **Tensor Decompositions** - Higher-order factorizations
